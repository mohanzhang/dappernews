DapperNews is a HackerNews clone for intelligent and attractive people.
Ideally, these people are also well-dressed. You know, people like yourself.

It is built with the following stack (top to bottom):

bootstrap 3
haml/sass
rails 4.0.2
ruby 2.0.0p353
rbenv
sqlite3

Because everyone on this forum will be intelligent, attractive, and
well-dressed, there will be no need for authentication or down-votes. People
are always honest, and always say intelligent things. This is by definition of
people being intelligent and attractive.  QED.

Ok, so you can tell this isn't a serious attempt despite the fact that we know
that something like DapperNews would actually devolve into the most glorious
dating site ever, thus solving one of the hardest problems known to man (and
woman).

I'm really just trying to get a quick refresh on the latest versions of my
favorite technologies. You have been warned.
